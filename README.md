A Journey Through Two Decades of Real Estate Trends

🏠 Why Real Estate?
The real estate market is like a living organism—it grows, crashes, adapts, and evolves. Over the past 20 years, it has weathered historic storms: the 2008 financial crisis, policy shifts, and even a pandemic. This project dives into the heartbeat of the market, uncovering patterns hidden in data to answer a critical question: What drives the value of the places we call home?

📜 The Story Begins: Questions We Asked
We set out to explore:

How did prices swing between booms, crashes, and recoveries?

What factors—like interest rates or property types—shaped these trends?

Can we predict future prices using machine learning?

Our mission? To turn raw data into actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and homeowners.

🛠️ How We Built the Story
Data Collection

Sourced 20 years of transaction records (2001–2022) from housing agencies and real estate platforms.

Captured property types, sale amounts, locations, and economic indicators like interest rates.

Cleaning the Canvas

Dropped incomplete records (e.g., missing tax remarks).

Fixed gaps in data: filled missing categories with common values, used medians for numbers.

Filtered out outliers (e.g., a $10 million shack? Probably a typo!).

The Tools of Discovery

Exploratory Analysis: Heatmaps, trend charts, and correlations revealed hidden patterns.

Machine Learning: Tested Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict prices.

🔍 Key Plot Twists: What We Uncovered
📈 Market Rollercoaster (2001–2022)
Boom (2001–2007): Easy credit fueled soaring prices. Peaked in 2005… then the cracks began.

Crash (2008–2010): Bubble burst. Foreclosures spiked, sales plummeted.

Recovery (2010–2022): Government stimulus and remote work reshaped demand. Suburbs boomed post-pandemic.

🏡 Property Types Tell a Tale
Single-Family Homes (56.2%): The undisputed champion, driven by generational demand.

Condos (14.7%): Thrived in cities among first-time buyers.

Commercial Properties (8%): Rose and fell with the economy’s tides.

🗺️ Location, Location, Location
New York City: Highest transaction volume (no surprise!).

Boston & Connecticut: Steady demand for luxury and commercial spaces.

🤖 Predicting the Future: Machines vs. Reality
Linear Regression: Struggled (36% accuracy). Prices are too wild for simple math!

Random Forest: Nailed it (72% accuracy). Why? It handles chaos—like how a condo’s value dips as years pass.

Top Price Drivers:

Assessed Value (Strong correlation: 0.62).

Property Type (Older homes sell less? Maybe millennials prefer new builds!).

🎯 The Moral of the Story
Real estate mirrors the economy’s highs and lows.

Policy and demographics are silent puppeteers.

Random Forest is the MVP for price predictions.
